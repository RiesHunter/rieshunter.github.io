### About
My work revolves around the evolution and pathogenesis of RNA viruses. I accomplish this by leveraging next-generation sequencing technologies and non-human primate models. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in [Dr. Thomas Friedrich's laboratory](https://friedrichlab.vetmed.wisc.edu/) through the Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. I have research interests in virus evolution, sequencing technologies, and public health applications of the two.
