My name is Hunter Ries ("Ries" is pronounced like "fleece"), and I am a Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. student in [Dr. Thomas Friedrich's laboratory](https://friedrichlab.vetmed.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. I aim to employ my background in emerging virus research toward a career in public health, where I apply cutting-edge laboratory research techniques and respond to emerging public health threats.

My current research revolves around the evolution and pathogenesis of RNA viruses, and I specialize in respiratory and mosquito-borne viruses. I utilize next-generation sequencing technologies to quantify the pressures shaping viral evolution during infection and transmission. Additionally, I utilize non-human primate models to assess the cross-reactive immunity and pathogenic potential of diverse flaviviruses, such as Zika virus and dengue virus.
