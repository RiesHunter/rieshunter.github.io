### About
My work revolves around the evolution of RNA virus. More specifically, I investigate how viruses change at the individual, population, and global scale by leveraging deep sequencing technologies and bioinformatics. I work closely with clinicians and public health officials to translate research findings and investigate real-world cases.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in [Dr. Thomas Friedrich's laboratory](https://friedrichlab.vetmed.wisc.edu/) through the Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. I have research interests in virus evolution, sequencing technologies, and public health applications of the two.
