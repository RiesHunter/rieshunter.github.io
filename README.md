My name is Hunter Ries (pronounced like "fleece"), and I am a Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. student in [Dr. Thomas Friedrich's laboratory](https://friedrichlab.vetmed.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

My research revolves around the evolution and pathogenesis of RNA viruses, where I specialize in respiratory and mosquito-borne viruses. Specifically, I utilize next-generation sequencing technologies to quantify the evolutionary pressures shaping viruses during infection and transmission. Additionally, I utilize non-human primate models to assess the cross-reactive immunity and pathogenic potential of diverse flaviviruses, such as Zika virus and dengue virus.
